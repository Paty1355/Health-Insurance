## Health Insurance Data Analysis and Machine Learning

In this project, I performed the following tasks:

1. **Data Analysis**: Analyzed health insurance data using Python.
2. **Data Preparation**: Prepared the data for machine learning algorithms.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Checked the scores and fine-tuned the best model.
4. **Predictions**: Made predictions on health insurance using new data.
5. **Feature Importance**: Visualized the importance of different features.

This comprehensive approach ensures robust and accurate predictions in health insurance models.
